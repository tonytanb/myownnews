## Monitoring Capabilities

### Agent Execution Logging

**What's Logged**:
- Agent start/stop times with microsecond precision
- Input/output data sizes and structure validation
- Retry attempts with exponential backoff tracking
- Error categorization (timeout, throttling, validation, network, etc.)
- Performance metrics (execution time, throughput, efficiency)
- Context information for debugging

**Storage**:
- DynamoDB for persistent storage with 7-day TTL
- CloudWatch Logs for centralized log aggregation
- In-memory storage for real-time access during execution

### Performance Monitoring

**CloudWatch Metrics**:
- `AgentExecutionTime`: Individual agent execution times
- `AgentExecutionSuccess`: Success/failure rates per agent
- `AgentRetryCount`: Retry attempts tracking
- `AgentExecutionError`: Error categorization and counting
- `OrchestrationTime`: Total orchestration duration
- `OrchestrationSuccessRate`: Overall success percentage
- `ParallelEfficiency`: Parallel execution effectiveness
- `SystemMemoryUsage`: Memory consumption monitoring
- `SystemCPUUsage`: CPU utilization tracking

**Performance Baselines**:
```python
{
    'NEWS_FETCHER': {'expected_time_ms': 15000, 'success_rate_threshold': 0.95},
    'CONTENT_CURATOR': {'expected_time_ms': 12000, 'success_rate_threshold': 0.95},
    'FAVORITE_SELECTOR': {'expected_time_ms': 10000, 'success_rate_threshold': 0.90},
    'SCRIPT_GENERATOR': {'expected_time_ms': 20000, 'success_rate_threshold': 0.95},
    'MEDIA_ENHANCER': {'expected_time_ms': 8000, 'success_rate_threshold': 0.85},
    'WEEKEND_EVENTS': {'expected_time_ms': 10000, 'success_rate_threshold': 0.90}
}
```

### Alerting System

**Real-time Alerts**:
- Orchestration timeout warnings
- Agent-specific failure pattern detection
- System resource exhaustion alerts
- Performance degradation notifications

## Debugging Tools

### Failure Pattern Analysis

**Automated Analysis**:
- Timeout failure counting and trending
- Throttling pattern detection
- Most frequently failing agents identification
- Average retry count analysis
- Error category distribution

**Debugging Recommendations**:
- Specific suggestions based on failure patterns
- Performance optimization recommendations

- Agent-specific troubleshooting guidance

### Real-time Monitoring

**Live Metrics**:
- Current orchestration progress percentage
- Running/completed/failed agent counts
- Estimated remaining time based on current performance
- Total execution time and retry counts
- Last updated timestamps for freshness validation
