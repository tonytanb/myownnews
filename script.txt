Alright, let's dive into what's happening around the world today. Honestly, we've got some wild news to cover, so let's get into it.

First up, the biggest story - the Israel-Gaza war is finally coming to an end, and it's all thanks to some major diplomatic moves. Get this - Hamas has freed all living hostages, and Israel has released Palestinian prisoners under a US-brokered ceasefire deal. President Trump is even hailing this as the "dawn of a new Middle East." Lowkey, it's about time we saw some progress in that region.

Moving over to the international scene, the US-China trade war is looking a little less tense. After Friday's market rout, President Trump is now saying that trade relations with China "will all be fine." Stocks have already clawed back more than half of Friday's losses, with the Dow rising a solid 600 points. Looks like the markets are feeling optimistic - at least for now.

Now for some business and tech news - the Titans have fired their head coach Brian Callahan after just a 1-5 start to the 2025 season. Callahan had a pretty rough run, finishing with a 4-19 record as the team's coach. That's your news update!
