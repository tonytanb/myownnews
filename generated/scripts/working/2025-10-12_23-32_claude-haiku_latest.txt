Alright, let's dive into what's happening around the world today. Honestly, we've got some wild stories coming your way, so let's get into it.

First up, the big news - the president has directed the Pentagon to pay troops during the government shutdown. Ngl, that's a pretty big deal. Apparently, this move will ensure that US military personnel don't miss their scheduled paychecks next week. Get this - it's all part of Trump's effort to make sure the shutdown doesn't impact the troops. Lowkey, that's a pretty smart move on his part.

Now, let's head over to Myanmar. There's a serious civil war going on, and it's left this strategic town called Kyaukme in shambles. Apparently, it's this once-thriving place in Shan State that's now being targeted by both sides because of its key location on the trading route to China. Wild, right? The AP journalist who covered this said it's just heartbreaking to see how the war has devastated this town.

Shifting gears to the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan - there's been some serious drama going down. Firefights broke out along the border late last Saturday, with the Afghan Taliban attacking Pakistani posts. That's your news update!
