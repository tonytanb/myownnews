Alright, let's dive into what's happening around the world today. 

First up, we've got a wild one - the president just directed the Pentagon to pay troops during the government shutdown. Honestly, this is a pretty big deal because it means US military personnel won't miss their paychecks next week, even though the shutdown is still going on. Get this - Trump's directive is supposed to ensure the troops get paid on time, no matter what's happening in Washington. Lowkey, it's kinda surprising he's taking this step, but I guess he doesn't want the troops to get caught in the middle of all the political drama.

Moving over to international news, things are getting pretty messy in Myanmar. There's a civil war going on, and it's left this strategic town called Kyaukme in total shambles. Apparently, both sides in the conflict have been targeting this place because of its key location on a major trade route to China. An Associated Press reporter went there, and the town is just devastated - buildings destroyed, people displaced, the whole nine yards. Ngl, it's a really sad situation.

Alright, let's switch gears to business and tech. That's your news update!
