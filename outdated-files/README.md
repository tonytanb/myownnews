# Outdated Files Archive 📁

This folder contains files that were part of the development process but are no longer needed for the main project. They're kept here for historical reference and to maintain a clean project structure.

## 📋 Contents

### Development Artifacts
- `curio-news-working-fix.py` - Early development script for testing fixes
- `response.json` - Sample API response used during development
- `save_to_downloads.sh` - Utility script for downloading files

### Test/Demo Files
- `test-simple.html` - Simple HTML test page
- `test-website.html` - Website testing page
- `debugging-dashboard-demo.html` - Early debugging dashboard prototype

### Documentation Drafts
- `FRESH_START_PROMPT.md` - Early project restart documentation

### Build Artifacts
- `bootstrap.zip` - Old deployment package
- `function-updated.zip` - Updated function package

## 🧹 Why These Were Moved

These files were moved to keep the main project directory clean and focused on the production-ready code and documentation. The main project now has:

- Clean, organized structure
- Production-ready code only
- Comprehensive documentation
- Working deployment artifacts

## 🔄 If You Need These Files

All files are preserved here and can be moved back to the main directory if needed for reference or debugging. However, the current production system should not depend on any of these files.

## 📚 Current Project Structure

For the current, clean project structure, see the main [README.md](../README.md) and [HACKATHON_SUBMISSION.md](../HACKATHON_SUBMISSION.md).
