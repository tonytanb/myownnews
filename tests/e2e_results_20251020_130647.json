        "script": "Alright, let's dive into what's happening today. Honestly, this first story is pretty wild - get this, Waymo's self-driving cars were caught on camera driving around a stopped school bus in Atlanta. Ngl, that's a major yikes for the safety of these autonomous vehicles. But Waymo says they've already updated the software, so hopefully they can avoid any more sketchy incidents like that.\n\nNext up, we've got some big news in the world of AI and healthcare. A platform called OpenEvidence, which is basically the ChatGPT for doctors, just raised $200 million at a $6 billion valuation. Lowkey, that's a huge deal. The platform helps medical professionals quickly access existing medical knowledge to treat patients better. Pretty cool, right?\n\nAnd in some gaming news, the mobile version of The Sims is shutting down next year. Honestly, that's a bummer for all the Sims fans out there. But the franchise is going through some changes, so maybe we'll see the beloved game make a comeback in a new way soon.\n\nFinally, let's talk about this new handheld gaming device from Anbernic. It's basically a clone of the Nintendo DS, but get this - it's gonna be cheaper than the original. Ngl, that's pretty impressive. Looks like it can play a bunch of classic DS and 3DS games, so it could be a fun little retro gaming device.\n\nAlright, that's the news for today, folks. Stay tuned for more updates, and let me know if you have any other questions!",
