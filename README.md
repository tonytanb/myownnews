## üîß Prerequisites

### Required API Keys
1. **News API Key**: Get free key at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org)
   - 1,000 requests/day on free tier
   - Access to 80,000+ news sources
   
2. **AWS Account**: Required for Claude, Polly, Lambda, and S3
   - **Claude access in us-west-2 region** (critical!)
   - Bedrock model access for Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku
   - IAM permissions for deployment

### Required Tools
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- AWS SAM CLI installed
- Python 3.11+
- Docker (for containerized builds)

## üì¶ Deployment

### 1. Clone and Configure
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd myownnews

# Configure your News API key in template.yaml
# Or set as parameter during deployment
```

### 2. Enable Claude Access in AWS Bedrock
**Critical Step**: Request Claude model access in us-west-2
```bash
# Go to AWS Bedrock Console in us-west-2
https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-west-2#/modelaccess

# Request access for:
# - Claude 3 Haiku
# - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (optional)
```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build the application
sam build --use-container

# Deploy to us-west-2 (where Claude is available)
sam deploy --region us-west-2 \
  --parameter-overrides \
    NewsApiKey=your-news-api-key \
    NewsCategories=general,technology,business,science \
    VoiceId=Joanna \
    MaxArticles=5
```

### 3. Test the Function
```bash
# Invoke the function manually
sam local invoke NewsToAudioFunction --event events/event.json

# Or test in AWS Console
aws lambda invoke --function-name <function-name> response.json
```
