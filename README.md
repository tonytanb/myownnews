# MyOwnNews üéôÔ∏è

**AI-Powered Daily News Brief Generator**

A serverless application that transforms breaking news into personalized audio briefings using AWS AI services. Built for busy professionals who want to stay informed without the noise.

## üöÄ Features

### Current Implementation
- **Smart News Aggregation**: Fetches top headlines from News API across multiple categories
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Uses Amazon Bedrock (Titan) to create concise, witty news scripts
- **Natural Audio Generation**: Converts text to lifelike speech using Amazon Polly
- **Serverless Architecture**: Fully managed AWS infrastructure with automatic scaling
- **Organized Storage**: Date-based file organization in S3 for scripts, audio, and metadata
- **Multi-Category Support**: Technology, business, and general news in one brief
- **Professional Tone**: Morning Brew-inspired writing style for engaging content

### Technical Highlights
- **Zero Server Management**: Built on AWS Lambda with SAM framework
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-per-execution model with AWS Free Tier compatibility
- **Scalable**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Secure**: IAM-based permissions with encrypted API keys
- **Maintainable**: Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation

## üîß Prerequisites

### Required API Keys
1. **News API Key**: Get free key at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org)
   - 1,000 requests/day on free tier
   - Access to 80,000+ news sources
   
2. **AWS Account**: Required for Bedrock, Polly, Lambda, and S3
   - Bedrock access in us-east-1 region
   - IAM permissions for deployment

### Required Tools
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- AWS SAM CLI installed
- Python 3.11+
- Docker (for containerized builds)

## üì¶ Deployment

### 1. Clone and Configure
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd myownnews

# Configure your News API key in template.yaml
# Or set as parameter during deployment
```

### 2. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build the application
sam build --use-container

# Deploy with guided setup (first time)
sam deploy --guided

# Or deploy with parameters
sam deploy \
  --parameter-overrides \
    NewsApiKey=your-news-api-key \
    NewsCategories=general,technology,business \
    VoiceId=Matthew \
    MaxArticles=5
```

### 3. Test the Function
```bash
# Invoke the function manually
sam local invoke NewsToAudioFunction --event events/event.json

# Or test in AWS Console
aws lambda invoke --function-name <function-name> response.json
```
