# Curio News - 3-Minute Video Script 🎬

*Techy but casual, millennial vibe with some humor*

---

## 🎯 Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:15)

**[Show yourself on camera, casual but professional]**

"Hey there! So, you know how reading the news has become like... a whole thing? Like, you either doom-scroll for 3 hours or you're completely out of touch with reality? Yeah, I felt that. So I built something that's basically like having your super smart friend give you the news over coffee, but with AI agents doing all the heavy lifting."

## 🤖 The Problem & Solution (0:15 - 0:45)

**[Screen: Show the frontend loading instantly]**

"Meet Curio News - and no, before you ask, it's not another news aggregator that just throws headlines at you. This thing is powered by 6 specialized AWS Bedrock agents that literally work together like a newsroom team."

**[Screen: Show the agent architecture diagram or debugging dashboard]**

"So we've got NEWS_FETCHER who's basically that friend who knows everything happening, CONTENT_CURATOR who's like 'okay but what actually matters,' FAVORITE_SELECTOR who picks the most interesting story, SCRIPT_GENERATOR who makes it sound conversational instead of like a robot wrote it, MEDIA_ENHANCER for the visual vibes, and WEEKEND_EVENTS because we all need plans, right?"

**[Quick laugh]** "It's like having 6 interns, but they never need coffee breaks and they don't judge your life choices."

## 🎵 The Cool Tech Demo (0:45 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Demo the interactive transcript]**

"But here's where it gets actually cool - see this transcript? It's not just text. Every single word is synced to the audio with millisecond precision. So if I click... here..."

**[Click a word, audio jumps to that exact moment]**

"BOOM. It jumps right to that moment. I know, I know, it sounds simple, but getting word-level timing from Polly and making it seamless? That was... a journey. Let's just say I have a very intimate relationship with AWS documentation now."

**[Screen: Show the debugging dashboard]**

"And because I'm a nerd who likes to see what's happening under the hood, there's this real-time debugging dashboard where you can literally watch the agents do their thing. It's like having x-ray vision for your AI system."

**[Screen: Show performance metrics]**

"Oh, and it's fast. Like, 0.33 seconds average response time fast. Because nobody has time for slow apps in 2024."

## 🛠 Technical Flex (1:30 - 2:15)

**[Screen: Show the architecture or code briefly]**

"Now, let's talk tech for a hot second. This isn't just some weekend project held together with duct tape and prayers. We're talking full AWS deployment with Lambda functions, DynamoDB for state management, S3 for storage, API Gateway for the REST endpoints, and obviously Bedrock for the AI magic."

**[Screen: Show test results]**

"I've got comprehensive test suites - performance testing, reliability testing, load testing. Because if you're gonna build something, might as well build it right, you know? 100% success rate on content delivery, handles concurrent users like a champ."

**[Back to camera]**

"And yes, it's actually deployed and running. This isn't a 'it works on my machine' situation. You can literally go use it right now."

---

## 🎯 The Innovation Angle (2:15 - 2:45)

**[Screen: Show the multi-agent orchestration in action]**

"Here's what makes this different from every other AI news thing out there - it's not just one model trying to do everything. It's specialized agents that are actually good at their specific jobs, working together. Kind of like how you wouldn't ask your frontend developer to also do your taxes, right?"

**[Screen: Show the user experience]**

"The result? You get news that doesn't sound like it was written by a committee of robots, delivered in a way that actually respects your time and attention span. Plus, you can interact with it in ways that feel natural."

**[Quick smile]** "And honestly? It's just fun to use. Which is more than I can say for most news apps these days."

---

## 🚀 Closing & Call to Action (2:45 - 3:00)

**[Back to camera, confident but humble]**

"So yeah, that's Curio News. Six AI agents, one smooth experience, zero doom-scrolling required. It's live, it's fast, it's actually useful, and it shows what's possible when you let AI agents do what they're good at instead of trying to make one model rule them all."

**[Screen: Show the URLs briefly]**

"Links are in the description if you want to try it out. And hey, if you're into this kind of multi-agent orchestration stuff, let's chat. I've got ideas."

**[Back to camera with a grin]**

"Thanks for watching, and remember - the future is multi-agent, and the future is now. Peace! ✌️"

## 📝 Production Notes

### Visual Cues
- **0:00-0:15**: You on camera, casual setup
- **0:15-0:45**: Screen share showing app + architecture
- **0:45-1:30**: Interactive demo of key features
- **1:30-2:15**: Quick tech overview with metrics
- **2:15-2:45**: Multi-agent orchestration demo
- **2:45-3:00**: Back to camera for closing

### Key URLs to Show
- Frontend: http://curio-news-frontend-1760997974.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
- GitHub: https://github.com/tonytanb/myownnews

### Tone Guidelines
- **Confident but not cocky**
- **Technical but accessible**
- **Casual but professional**
- **Enthusiastic but not over-the-top**
- **A few light jokes but stay focused**

### Backup Talking Points (if you need to fill time)
- "Built this for the AWS Agent Hackathon because I wanted to show what's possible with Bedrock"
- "The whole thing is open source, so you can see exactly how the agent orchestration works"
- "Performance testing shows it can handle way more load than my bank account can afford in AWS costs"

### If Demo Fails
- "And if the demo gods aren't smiling today, don't worry - I've got screenshots and the code is all on GitHub"
- Keep talking about the architecture and innovation while showing static content
