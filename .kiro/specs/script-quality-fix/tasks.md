## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order

1. **Critical Path**: Fix agent orchestration and individual agent failures (tasks 1.x, 2.x)
2. **Content Quality**: Implement validation and error handling (tasks 3.x)
3. **API Integration**: Fix bootstrap endpoint completeness (tasks 4.x)
4. **User Experience**: Update frontend to handle complete content (tasks 5.x)
5. **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and debugging (tasks 6.x)
6. **Validation**: End-to-end testing and performance validation (tasks 7.x)

### Success Validation

Each task should be validated by:

- Testing that all 6 agents complete successfully
- Verifying all content sections are populated in the frontend
- Confirming no perpetual loading states remain
- Validating error handling and recovery mechanisms work properly

### Risk Mitigation

- **Agent Failures**: Implement comprehensive retry and fallback mechanisms
- **Timeout Issues**: Add proper timeout handling with graceful degradation
- **Content Quality**: Validate all generated content meets minimum standards
- **Performance**: Monitor execution times and optimize bottlenecks

This implementation plan systematically addresses the incomplete content generation issue by fixing agent orchestration, improving error handling, and ensuring all content sections are generated reliably.
