# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Curio News platform is only partially completing content generation. While basic news stories are being generated successfully, the system fails to generate additional content sections including Today's Favorite Story, Weekend Recommendations, and Visual Enhancements. These sections remain in perpetual loading states, indicating that some of the 6 specialized Bedrock agents are failing to complete their tasks or the orchestration system is not properly coordinating all agents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all content sections to be generated successfully so that I get a complete news experience with favorite stories, weekend recommendations, and visual enhancements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content generation starts THEN all 6 specialized agents SHALL complete their tasks successfully
2. WHEN the bootstrap endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return complete data for all content sections
3. WHEN agents are orchestrated THEN the system SHALL ensure no agent fails silently or gets stuck
4. WHEN content generation completes THEN favorite story, weekend recommendations, and visual enhancements SHALL be populated

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable agent orchestration so that content generation doesn't get stuck in loading states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent orchestration begins THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout handling for each agent
2. WHEN an agent fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation or provide fallback content
3. WHEN agents are running THEN the system SHALL track progress and detect stuck processes
4. WHEN orchestration completes THEN all agent statuses SHALL be properly updated and accessible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive agent monitoring so that I can identify which specific agents are failing and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are invoked THEN the system SHALL log detailed execution information for each agent
2. WHEN agent failures occur THEN the system SHALL capture and store error details
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the trace endpoint SHALL provide complete agent execution history
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track execution times for each agent

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent content quality across all sections so that every part of the news experience meets the same standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN favorite stories are generated THEN they SHALL meet the same quality standards as main news stories
2. WHEN weekend recommendations are created THEN they SHALL be relevant and properly formatted
3. WHEN visual enhancements are selected THEN they SHALL be appropriate and accessible
4. WHEN any content section is generated THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with the overall user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and reliable content generation so that I don't have to wait for stuck loading processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content generation starts THEN all sections SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN agents are processing THEN users SHALL see accurate progress indicators
3. WHEN generation is complete THEN all loading states SHALL be replaced with actual content
4. IF any agent fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery options
