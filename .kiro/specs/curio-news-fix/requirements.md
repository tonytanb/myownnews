# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Curio News is an AI-powered news curation system that demonstrates 6 specialized Bedrock Agents working together to solve real-world news consumption challenges for Gen Z/Millennial audiences. The system needs to be completely functional, judge-ready, and showcase the full power of AWS Bedrock Agent orchestration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Functional Backend API System

**User Story:** As a judge evaluating the AWS Agent Hackathon submission, I want to see a fully functional backend API that responds correctly to all endpoints, so that I can evaluate the technical implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the `/bootstrap` endpoint THEN the system SHALL return valid JSON with news content, script, and metadata
2. WHEN I call the `/generate-fresh` endpoint THEN the system SHALL trigger real Bedrock Agent orchestration
3. WHEN I call the `/agent-status` endpoint THEN the system SHALL return current agent progress information
4. WHEN I call the `/trace/{traceId}` endpoint THEN the system SHALL return detailed agent provenance data
5. IF any endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL include proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests

### Requirement 2: Six Specialized Bedrock Agents Working Together

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see 6 distinct Bedrock Agents collaborating in real-time, so that I can evaluate the multi-agent orchestration capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates content THEN the News Fetcher Agent SHALL gather trending stories from RSS feeds and NewsAPI
2. WHEN news is fetched THEN the Content Curator Agent SHALL select exactly 5 stories for balanced briefing
3. WHEN stories are curated THEN the Favorite Selector Agent SHALL identify the most fascinating "wow factor" story
4. WHEN content is selected THEN the Script Generator Agent SHALL create millennial-friendly 90-second audio scripts
5. WHEN script is generated THEN the Media Enhancer Agent SHALL suggest visual content and accessibility features
6. WHEN media is enhanced THEN the Weekend Events Agent SHALL recommend cultural activities and trends
7. WHEN all agents complete THEN the system SHALL provide complete provenance tracking of all agent decisions

### Requirement 3: Professional Judge-Ready Frontend

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to interact with a professional, responsive web interface that showcases the AI agents in action, so that I can evaluate the user experience and technical polish.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the frontend URL THEN the system SHALL display a professional landing page with clear branding
2. WHEN I click "Play Today's Brief" THEN the system SHALL immediately start audio playback with cached content
3. WHEN audio plays THEN the system SHALL highlight words in the transcript in real-time (karaoke-style)
4. WHEN agents are working THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress with emoji indicators (üì∞‚ÜíüéØ‚Üí‚≠ê‚Üíüìù‚Üíüé®‚Üíüéâ)
5. WHEN content is displayed THEN the system SHALL show curated news items with categories and relevance scores
6. WHEN I click "View agent trace" THEN the system SHALL open a detailed provenance page showing all agent activities
7. IF I'm on mobile THEN the system SHALL be fully responsive and functional

### Requirement 4: Real News Integration and Content Quality

**User Story:** As a user of the news system, I want to receive actual current news content curated by AI agents, so that I get valuable, up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fetches news THEN it SHALL use the provided NewsAPI key (56e5f744fdb04e1e8e45a450851e442d)
2. WHEN news is processed THEN the system SHALL generate scripts with millennial tone using "honestly", "lowkey", "ngl", "get this"
3. WHEN audio is generated THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Polly with proper word timing data
4. WHEN content is cached THEN the system SHALL provide instant user experience while generating fresh content in background
5. IF fresh content is ready THEN the system SHALL hot-swap the audio and content seamlessly

### Requirement 5: Complete AWS Infrastructure Integration

**User Story:** As a technical evaluator, I want to see proper AWS service integration and infrastructure as code, so that I can assess the architectural quality and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use SAM (Serverless Application Model) for infrastructure as code
2. WHEN Lambda functions execute THEN they SHALL have proper IAM permissions for Bedrock, Polly, S3, and DynamoDB
3. WHEN content is generated THEN it SHALL be stored in S3 with proper public access configuration
4. WHEN agent status is tracked THEN it SHALL use DynamoDB with TTL for efficient caching
5. WHEN API Gateway is configured THEN it SHALL have proper CORS settings for all endpoints
6. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL have proper error handling and graceful fallbacks

### Requirement 6: Demonstrable Agent Provenance and Transparency

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge focused on AI transparency, I want to see complete visibility into how the 6 agents made their decisions, so that I can evaluate the explainability of the AI system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents process content THEN the system SHALL log each agent's input, processing, and output
2. WHEN a trace is requested THEN the system SHALL show detailed information about each agent's role and decisions
3. WHEN content is presented THEN the system SHALL explain why specific stories were selected
4. WHEN the favorite story is chosen THEN the system SHALL provide reasoning for the selection
5. WHEN script tone is applied THEN the system SHALL show examples of millennial language choices
6. IF agents fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior

## Success Criteria

The system will be considered successful when:
- All API endpoints return valid responses without "Internal server error"
- The frontend displays real content and allows interaction without "Failed to fetch" errors
- Audio playback works with real Polly-generated content
- Interactive transcript highlights words as audio plays
- Agent trace page shows detailed provenance information
- The system demonstrates all 6 Bedrock Agents working together
- Mobile responsiveness is maintained across all features
- The demo is ready for live presentation to hackathon judges
