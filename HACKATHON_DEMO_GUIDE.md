## 📊 Judge Questions - Prepared Answers

### "How does the multi-agent orchestration work?"
"We have 6 specialized agents that run in parallel where possible, with a central orchestrator managing their execution, timeouts, and data flow. Each agent has a specific role - from news gathering to script generation - and they pass structured data between each other to create the final news briefing."

### "What makes this production-ready?"
"Full AWS deployment with monitoring, comprehensive error handling, performance testing showing 100% success rates, graceful degradation, and real-time debugging capabilities. We have extensive test suites validating performance, reliability, and user experience."

### "How do you handle agent failures?"
"We have timeout handling, retry logic, fallback mechanisms, and graceful degradation. If an agent fails, the system continues with available content rather than failing completely. All failures are logged and monitored."

### "What's innovative about the user experience?"
"The interactive transcript with word-level timing synchronization - users can click any word to jump to that exact moment in the audio. Combined with real-time agent monitoring, it creates a unique, engaging experience."
